Worked alongside another developer to create reusable React components that saved over 30 hours of development work in the future. Improved existing React projects by refactoring, building custom React hooks to make the app's logic reusable which resulted in 2x faster new feature implementation. Optimized 10+ web apps & websites for maximum speed, accessibility, and SEO which helped to reduce by 20% the cost-per-lead within one of the projects.",
